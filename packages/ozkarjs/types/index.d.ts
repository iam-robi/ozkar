 * G - Guanine: One of the four primary nucleotides in DNA.
 * T - Thymine: One of the four primary nucleotides in DNA.
 * U - Uracil: A nucleotide in RNA that replaces Thymine found in DNA.
 * N - Any/Unknown: Used to represent an unknown or any nucleotide.
 * R - A or G (purines)
 * Y - C, T, or U (pyrimidines)
 * K - G, T, or U (keto)
